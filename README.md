 This Laravel project is a payment gateway integration that allows users to make payments using either PayPal or the Laravel Stripe payment gateway. The project includes separate templates for each payment gateway, and users can choose which payment method to use at checkout. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it easy to customize and integrate into your own projects.
